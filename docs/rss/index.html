People were very cool, unjudgmental and very calm. Usually cities are very different as people tend to be fast and look in a hurry. The other thing I noticed is the graffiti all over the streets, which I ignored in the first few days. I was looking at these graffiti, as just a street vandalism, however I realised it was more of an art as soon as I saw this one in Calea Grivi&#x21B;ei. </p><p>The usual graffiti that I noticed were all just names of artists and some weird looking paintings. However, this one caught my attention as it can&apos;t be a joke. The artist had put a lot of time designing this and painting it on such a large wall. I quickly realised the entire painting had a lot of text embedded in it, so I took a picture and walked away. I did a lot of search to understand what this art has hidden beneath. Rest of the article talks about, what I was able to decode from art.</p><blockquote><strong>KERO-IRLO-OCU</strong></blockquote><p>At the very top of the painting you can see names of the artists, Kero, Irlo and Ocu. A quick search on the internet shows that they are quite famous in Romania for a previously controversial painting that was taken down immediately after it was public. This painting, to some extend looks like a revenge on taking down their previous work.</p><p>Kero in an interview says, the painting is not a revenge but based on the words: &quot;De ce vezi tu paiul din ochiul fratelui t&#x103;u &#x219;i nu te ui&#x21B;i cu b&#x103;gare de seam&#x103; la b&#xE2;rna din ochiul t&#x103;u?&quot; which translates to &quot;Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brother&#x2019;s eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?&quot;.</p><p>Ocu said in an interview, &quot;The leopard symbolizes the slow and unconscious movement of our negative side, the automatisms hidden deep in various portion of the mind. Once aware, this movement helps to observe different situations with clarity and transform them into positive parts of life. We move in the direction of self-development through self-observation, and not by judging those around us.&quot;</p><blockquote><strong>The leopard</strong></blockquote><p>The very first thing you notice is the angry leopard and the fence. There is a famous saying in Romania, &quot;&#xCE;n&#x103;untru-i vopsit gardul &#x219;i afar&#x103;-i leopardul&quot;. The translation means, &quot;Outside is a painted fence, inside is a leopard&quot;. Though the expression sounds meaningless in literal terms, Romanians use this expression to emphasize the glaring difference between what is seen and what is reality. </p><p>There is a different meaning behind this saying, which is believed to be the origin. In a circus, there is usually a huge drawing with leopards and other animals to attract the customers. The employee of circus shouts, &quot;The fence is painted outside, the leopard is inside.&quot;. This means, &quot;What you see outside is just a painting and there is a live beast inside for which you need to buy tickets&quot;. However, the meaning of how this expression used today is very different.</p><p>If you take a deeper look at the leopard, the rosette spots on the leopard are not random. They have continuous words that says <em>&quot;Acesta nu este un leopard. Acestea sunt fricile noastre. Petele noastre. P&#x103;catele noastre. &#xCE;nainte s&#x103; o dai de gard, &#xEE;ntreab&#x103;-te: ce e un leopard?&quot;</em> which directly translates to &quot;This is not a leopard. These are our fears. Our spots. Our sins. Before you jump on the fence, ask yourself: what is a leopard?&quot;. You can also notice the copyright symbol at the end of the tail &quot;&#xA9; 2020&quot;. </p><p>The huge chain in the leopard&apos;s mouth is taken from a character&apos;s neck who is rich and preaches things that he does not follow for himself. </p><p><em>Overall, the fierce expression of the leopard conveys that the things you hide will come back and haunt you. </em></p><blockquote><strong>The spiritual leader removing the graffiti</strong></blockquote><p>The character who looks like a religious leader in the foreground layer, removes the graffiti on the fences while he himself wearing a cloth made of graffiti. This definitely sounds like a revenge on the previous work by the same artists being taken down due to pressure from a nearby church. This remind me of the saying &quot;When one person makes an accusation, check to be sure he himself is not the guilty one. Sometimes it is those whose case is weak who make the most clamour.&quot;. The art beautifully portrays the same saying.</p><blockquote><strong>Learning</strong></blockquote><p>I was staring at this photo for a week, and read from various sources to write this article. Couldn&apos;t find a single place where I could decode what the artist was saying, so putting everything I learnt from this art. </p><p>What was shocking to me, is the fact that this is not just graffiti but a revolution by art. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[The dream of reaching near space]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h3 id="story-from-1990s">Story from 1990s:</h3><p>Around the 1990s, my parents moved to a rented house in the center of our home town Rajapalayam.

Thats when I first met our landlord Mr.Rajalingam Raja who was a retired businessman. He closed his grocery store business and started doing small finance for the rest of his life. While, I am introducing him as my landlord, he has never been like one. He has always been a best friend, mentor and a God father to me, despite being 50 yrs elder than me. </p><h3 id="mr-rajalingam-raja">Mr. Rajalingam Raja:</h3><p>Despite his limited education qualification and exposure, he had a deep passion towards electronics. He understood electrical and electronics very well just from his passion towards technology. This was a skill that he gained by constant learning despite his age. For the first time in my life, I came across someone who had a hobby which was not related to their profession. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/Rajalingaraja-2.JPG" class="kg-image" alt="The dream of reaching near space" loading="lazy" width="747" height="736"><figcaption>Rajalingam Raja, Rajapalayam</figcaption></figure><p>While, he is not alive this day to share my current hobbies and see the advancements, I always consider him a God father close to heart because of whom I am what I am today. </p><blockquote>If I had not met him back then, I can&apos;t imagine what I would be today. I would definitely not have got the interest towards electronics which eventually transformed into a passion for software programming. </blockquote><h3 id="team-225">Team 2.25:</h3><p>My Godfather had a very close friend with whom he shared his dreams and hobbies. Mr. Subbiah Raja is another great person who had deep passion towards photography and technology. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/Subbiahraja-2.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="The dream of reaching near space" loading="lazy" width="273" height="275"></figure><p>Together they were dreaming about flying a balloon filled with light weight gases and attach a small blinking light to prank their friends about a UFO. This was a top secret project which was never revealed to anyone other than we 3 as far as I know. They were dreaming about connecting a small light bulb to a battery and make it blink at a certain frequency. They would often brainstorm about this idea and had an unsolved challenge of producing the lightweight gases. The number 2 in the title comes from these 2 gentlemen with great ambitions and the 0.25 comes from a 5th grader who joined their dream club.</p><p>Unfortunately they never achieved this dream but they embedded the idea in to my head so deep that even after 3 decades the idea keeps floating in my head. I remember every conversation they had about this idea and the dreams I had after each discussion. </p><h3 id="attempt-1-2008-09">Attempt #1 (2008-09):</h3><p>In 2008, I decided to actually try this out in a more modern way, when I came across a video online about another near space experiment. However, after a long gap in electronics, I couldn&apos;t complete that dream and gave up after burning the GPS and RF chips which were imported from UK. The year 2008 ended up bit tough at work and had to put a big pause to this dream again. </p><h3 id="attempt-2-2020-21">Attempt #2 (2020-21):</h3><p>After more than a decade, and more recent involvement electronics hobbies with Raspberry Pi, I decided to resume this dream again. This time, I had more ideas and lot of prev experiments to follow. Decided to add a lot of new ideas on to the original dream and made more scientific goals to it then just pranking someone. I started building a Near space satellite project with electronic components commercially available for any electronic enthusiast today. </p><h3 id="ralisat-1">RaLiSat-1: </h3><p>Decided to name it after my Godfather, in his memories. I continue with my dream this time with more knowledge and focus. It took me a year (on and off, mostly during weekends) to fully assemble, test and launch the satellite. Here is a series of blogposts from the past related to RaLiSat-1. </p><ol><li><a href="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/ralisat-1-payload-design/?ref=localhost">Payload system design</a></li><li><a href="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/ralisat-1-payload-design-challenges/?ref=localhost">Payload design challenges</a></li><li><a href="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/ground-station/?ref=localhost">Base station system design</a></li></ol><p>Test scenarios include putting it into a freezer to test sub-zero temperatures. Of course, even with max settings my parents refrigerator could only get to -12&#xB0;C, while the worst case in real-world near space can ready -60&#xB0;C. I definitely under estimated this to be close to -45&#xB0;C but it seems to have reached -63&#xB0;C even at 14 kms altitude. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/hab-15-175058-1.jpg" width="640" height="360" loading="lazy" alt="The dream of reaching near space"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/hab-15-175602-2.jpg" width="640" height="360" loading="lazy" alt="The dream of reaching near space"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/hab-15-175951-1.jpg" width="640" height="360" loading="lazy" alt="The dream of reaching near space"></div></div></div></figure><p>And the dashboard looked like this while the communication was lost with the payload. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2022/05/Screenshot-2022-05-15-at-7.25.36-PM.png" class="kg-image" alt="The dream of reaching near space" loading="lazy" width="1920" height="1080"></figure><h3 id="why-did-i-try-this">Why did I try this?</h3><p>While this is a popular hobby among electronics and near space enthusiasts in some part of the world, it is not a common thing in India.

To explain the complexity in building the software, the framebuffer alone for storing the on-screen pixel details takes 153.6 KB (320 width * 240 height * 2 bytes). While the LCD display supports upto 262K colors, I decided to use only 2 bytes for each pixel to save the RAM usage. To store RGB888, the total memory needed is 230 KB which is more than 85% of the RAM size. Also, we can&apos;t do double buffering like most games do, the traditional way.

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><p>The most complex part of software was the frame-buffer implementation. There are 2 modes available for the games, one of-course using the framebuffer that takes 154 kbs of the RAM and update the display memory periodically, or just stream the changes directly to the display. The other complexity is using both the cores available in the chip. Unlike CPUs, the MCU cores are bit different in the way you can use threads in your code. </p><p>Just to give you an idea on the complexity again, the splash screen that shows the tiger logo uses full frame buffer and loads the image which is another 32 kb along with a basic font image which is 12 kb. The total RAM used is around 200 kbs already, so my code had to be written very carefully on variable usage and memory allocation. Ex: Use 8bit variable type whereever possible. I can&apos;t assume int by default for anything, as it takes 32 bits. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/edIZAm9zVC8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>The sample game as always is Snake game very similar to what we use to have in Nokia 1100 handsets.

This is an expensive eInk display with 1872x1404 pixel resolution that supports 4 bit grayscale values. </p><p><strong>Objective:</strong> Building a photo frame with the content streamed from my home server built using a Raspberry Pi. The RPi will stream family pics available in the storage and intermittently show home power consumption dashboard on screen. </p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> As with any project, this one had very particular challenge of keeping the hardware simple. ESP32 has Wifi support but not enough RAM to hold the frame buffer needed. The display has 2628288 pixels each needs 4 bit which makes it 1.25 MB. The MCU that is going to drive the display needs &#xA0;at least 1.25MB as a frame buffer. The reason for this expectation is, the display needs the data available to the driver in a sequence of commands. </p><p>Our powerful ESP32 has only 500 KB of RAM and not all is available to the program. The display is driven by IT8951 chip module. The available driver for IT8951, open sourced by the device manufacturer does not support streaming or ESP32 chip. Their code assumes the entire image buffer is available before pushing it to the driver. </p><p>After taking a look at how the code works, I had some hope that this can be achieved by rewriting the code. However, the chip and the display were going to be powered using battery and needs to be as efficient as possible. I had to rewrite most part of the buffering and remove the need to RAM. </p><p>I used a TCP connection between RPi and ESP32. My ESP32 code will listen to TCP port 8319. The RPi code is written using python and configured as a cron job. Every time the code randomly pushes an image from a given directory. The whole post processing like resizing and color conversion had to be done at RPi as this cannot be handled in the ESP32 for lack of RAM. The ESP32 code receives the sequence of bytes from RPi and directly streams it to the IT8951 module. I was able to achieve this easily and got an image displayed on screen. Please ignore the noise in the image which comes from encoding issue which I solved later. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2022/01/FE4A22F8-115B-4A3A-BF47-174564B4F3F0_1_105_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Remote ePaper display using ESP32" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768"></figure><p>After fixes the noise issue, and getting a proper image on screen, I had another challenge. It took upto 30 seconds to stream a full size image from RPi which is way too much for what we are doing. I realised the TCP overhead for each packet added-up and eventually slowed down the whole thing. </p><p>I added intermediate buffering. Our ESP32 has some RAM which cannot be ignored. So I decided to buffer the data stream which should speed up the task. Instead of reading each byte from the TCP socket, I configured the code to read a buffer of 1KB. The buffer size is configurable. After reading the buffer, TCP socket is free to receive more data and meanwhile, I can push the data to IT8951. When trying with 1KB, I was able to stream the content in less than a second which was my target. </p><p>The reason for having 1 second as a target is, the refresh rate of the display is more than a second, so I anyway have to wait for the display to get ready. Finally the streaming worked perfect and but images had some issue. If you notice the below picture, you see the text pixelated. This was definitely not how the image looked. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2022/01/FE91959F-EABF-4F1A-A4E8-D2D6E151ACEC_1_105_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Remote ePaper display using ESP32" loading="lazy" width="1044" height="752"></figure><p>After fighting for a whole day, I figured out that I was sending the pixel data in BIG Endian formate which the device was configured to receive in LITTLE endian format. &#xA0;After fixing this issue, the picture looked perfect on screen. unfortunately many open-source drivers available in Github has similar issue. The issue does not show-up well when you display an image, but is very much noticeable when you display text. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2022/01/0EB99228-8C55-4F3A-83AD-CC8C73C0F983_1_105_c.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Remote ePaper display using ESP32" loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768"></figure><p>In the picture above, I&apos;ve scrapped the Grafana dashboard and streamed it to the display. I used selenium to take screenshot of the page and used the same code to push it to the display.

At around 25 kms which is my target for this project, the temperature is -56&#xB0;C. This is way beyond the range of operating temperature for any commercial electronic. </p><p><strong>Generic Solution: </strong>Most projects use a Polystyrene boxes and add a heat source like hand warmer to keep the container within the right temperature. This approach further increases the size of the payload and the weight. &#xA0;</p><p><strong>Solution Used:</strong> As a design target, I wanted the payload weight to be less than 240 grams. Primary reason is to use as less helium as possible and use 350 gram balloon. I built a styrofoam cube using layered sheets with all electronic components within each layer and enclosed it. The components were fitted within small engraving in the layers and used super glue to fit the layers perfectly. Obviously the GPS ceramic antenna, environment sensor, camera and Lora antenna had to be left outside. The overall design looks like the below image. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2021/12/IMG_5967.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1024" height="537"></figure><p><strong>Test Scenarios:</strong> To test the design, the primary approach I tried was, leaving the system inside a freezer (-20&#xB0;C) to see the min/max CPU temperatures for upto 2 hours. My test criteria was to keep the CPU temperature between 35&#xB0;C and 75&#xB0;C. This is very hard to accomplish, as the Raspberry Pi Zero does not have any airflow and easily reached 75&#xB0;C even when put inside the freezer. Then I make lot of performance tuning to the system to balance the CPU usage and heat produced. At a certain point, I was able to see the temperature was stable at most environmental conditions. I tested in direct sunlight, inside the freezer and room temperature, and the CPU temperature in all conditions were well within the range. </p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion:</h3><p>Finally I was able to reach a point where, I had to never worry about the internal temperatures reaching unexpected ranges. But remember, I took around a month to stablise this. I tried to under-clock the Raspberry Pi, but gave up on that option as it reduced the heat generation drastically and the internal CPU temperatures reached unexpected low 10&#xB0;C within 25 mins in the freezer. I couldn&apos;t reach a stable temperature range with enough computing power when under-clocking the RPi. I did try writing a CPU intensive &#xA0;bash script which will run for few seconds to increase the temperature if it went below certain range. </p><blockquote>Finally, understanding what part of the code produces more heat and configuring how often it can run, helped solve this problem. </blockquote><p>The GPU usage, especially the camera image capture and resizing part was the one which produced enough heat, to make it work.

Infact, RPi Zero was bit too much for my goal, however, it comes handy and I already had one from my previous projects. The main intension was to keep the design as plug-n-play as possible. I previous attempt in flight computer failed in 2008 primarily because of this reason. RPi camera was an easy option to decide as it is very compact and integration is easy.</p><h3 id="bme680-environmental-sensors">BME680 Environmental Sensors: </h3><p>SeeedStudio&apos;s BME680 sensor module looked very impressive as it supports i2c interface and had all sensors I expected in one module. One downside, the pressure and temperature sensors had an operating range of 300-1100hPa and -40~+85 respectively. With a goal of reaching 25 kms altitude, the environment is going to be at -56 degree celsius and 25 hPa which are both out of the range of the sensors. However, beyond this reading it is very hard to find a sensor that is cheap with integration options as easy as this one. So I decided to go anyway and see how it works. </p><h3 id="gps-module">GPS Module:</h3><p>With no knowledge about how the pressure sensor will work beyond 300 hPa, the only other option is to use a GPS module that will work with target altitude.

The desire was always there deep inside and never sparked until my daughter had to do some school activity on aquariums. So we decided to buy a small 10 liter aquarium tank with 3 molly fishes. To our surprise, the fishes started giving birth and the desire got intensified. So we planned to setup a 150 Liter large aquarium in our house and do some lanscaping with beautiful plants. </p><p>After 6 months of hardwork, we were able to reach to the below state. Please don&apos;t judge me on the landscaping skills. Our objective was to simulate the closest natural habitate of the fishes we had. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2021/12/IMG_0571-1.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="3714" height="1719"></figure><h3 id="challenges-and-why-automation">Challenges and why automation:</h3><p>If you are an aquarium enthusiast like me and have tried planted tank, the challenges are going to be very obvious. You need to maintain lot of things like good bacteria level, CO2 level plants, O2 level for fishes, overall lighting for plants, fish food, and ofcourse plants need nutritions as well. The challenges grow from there to weekly water maintanence and trimming the plants. Overall, I got bit frustrated to repeatedly do lot of these things on a daily basis. As a programmer, my brain motivated to automate it. The overall challenge is to schedule various equipements based on below requirements.</p><ol><li>High intensity plant lights need to be switched on for only a few hours during the day.</li><li>Low intensity light needs to be ON for an before and after plant lights are ON. Just to simulate dawn and dusk.</li><li>CO2 needs to be ON around the same time as high intensity light as the plants will only consume CO2 when there is light. The CO2 tank needs to be switched off 30 mins before the high intesity lights to save CO2.</li><li>Air pump to bring up the O2 level after the CO2 is OFF. O2 is essential for the fishes and plants at night, so the pump has to work all the time other than CO2 flow.</li><li>Heavy duty filter needs to work only for few hours of the day as it should be enough to clean up the dirt and fish waste. There is another filter that work round the clock which is less powerful.</li><li>Water cooler to bring down and maintain the water temperature during the day time. My location is mostly very hot during the day. </li><li>Did I forget about feeding the fishes? Yes, I made a small feeder using a motor and food container with a small hole. </li></ol><h3 id="electronics">Electronics:</h3><p>The overall automation setup is very simple, as all these equipments already were connected to power and only needed manual swtching on and off. I decided to go with a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and a relay controller module. The wiring is simple as the relay module needs to be connected to 8 GPIO pins for On/Off signal. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="./../content/images/2021/12/8-channel-relay-module-10a-640x640.jpg-copy.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="470" height="205"><figcaption>Relay module</figcaption></figure><p>The overall setup had the relay module connected to a power extension so the same setup can be reused in future.

For example, we wanted the high intensity lights to be switched on if someone wants to take a look at the Aquarium. The below image shows the web page to control the individual equipments manually.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2021/12/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="560" height="1213"></figure><p>On top of this, I&apos;ve been already using this Raspberry Pi as a home server and local DNS server with PiHole software running.

No wait, with all known issues fixed. And the Aquarium managed to last for 8 months without any human intervension during the Covid-19 country wide lockdown. We had to move to our native town early during the lockdown and couldn&apos;t goto the citi for 8 months. All we had was this automated setup that worked well and kept most fishes alive. The only manual work during the last 2 years, was changing water and refilling fish food once in 3 to 5 months. </p><blockquote>I would say, this was one of the remarkable works I&apos;ve every done to save lives. :-) </blockquote>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Interfacing Ublox GPS M8N with Raspberry Pi]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Ublox GPS M8N module support UART communication and its fairly integrate with your Raspberry Pi.

To be honest, this seemed to me like a life saver for hobbyists to start on RF. My previous attempts failed with I had to add RF to my projects. This time it was mostly a plug and play with simple configurations. </p><h3 id="speed">Speed: </h3><p>I read everywhere saying Lora is for smaller data packets and are not meant for larger data like images. There were some calculations showing Lora would take hours or days to transfer a single image. These are not fully true and are mostly limited to certain providers. In my project I needed a P2P data transfer and it worked just fine. </p><p>Initially I started with transfering 40 bytes of sensor data every 5 seconds which worked just fine. After analysing the logs, I found that the Chip completes the air transmission in few milliseconds and just waits for more data. So I decided to push more data by breaking an image into chunks and rebuilding it on the receiver size. </p><p>An image of size 38KB takes me around 5 mins to transfer with enough delay inbetween to avoid the buffer overflows. There is no easy way to calculate the exact delay needed for each chunk to get transfered, or depending on AUX alone as well did not help my case much. So I&apos;ve implemented a hybrid aproach that worked for me.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./../content/images/2021/12/latest-7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="360"></figure><h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement:</h3><p>In my implementation, the Lora class accepts file size of upto few megabytes and internally splits and sends it in chunks. The sender ensures if the chunk was received successfully by marking the chunk after getting an acknowledgement. The reason why AUX alone didn&apos;t work for me was, both the transceivers had to send and receive messages and the module didn&apos;t support duplex transmission. So a predefined interval of delay helped in my case. Otherwise, the 38KB image can be transferred in less than a minute. </p><h3 id="implementation">Implementation:</h3><p>The source code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/codetiger/rpi-hab/blob/main/lora.py?ref=localhost">Github project</a>. The Lora class uses SQLite for keeping track of chunks and acknowledgements.

Especially for electronics hobbyists like me who are self taught and have very limited knowledge in RF communication domain, these new Lora modules have made life easier. There is no introduction needed for these modules as the entire community is talking about, so I straightaway jump into the subject. </p><p>For my recent hobby project (shall be explained in future posts), I need a long range communications module between 2 Raspberry Pi based devices. The approximate distance is roughly 30 kms within line of sight. The 30kms and line of sight should be enough to guess what am planning to do. However, I&apos;ll still keep that for another post. The easiest way to achieve long range communication today without the need for licenses, is using a Lora module. As it already supports ISM band and modules are already available for various bands depending on the country. </p><h3 id="regulations">Regulations:</h3><p>In India, the ISM band range of frequency 865 - 867 MHz is delicensed and allocated for general purpose use. The regulatory documents say, we are allowed to use a max of 1w transmission power within this range. The standard Lora modules are pre-configured for various global ISM bands like 433MHz, 868MHz and 915MHz. Now, if you notice, none of these frequencies are within the ISM band in India. Closest is 868MHz however, it is outside of the specified range. </p><p>Thanks to the operating frequency range of the Lora modules, each model supports a range of frequencies meant to support a range of channels. The device I chose for my project is E32-868T30D which supports frequency range from 862 MHz to 893 MHz. I was bit confused as the regulations did not explicitly mention whether the 865 and 867 frequencies are inclusive in the allowed range. So just to be on the safer side, I configured by devices to communicate in 866 MHz which is well within the range.</p><h3 id="lora-e32-868t30d">Lora E32-868T30D:</h3><p>In fact, I did a lot of research on various modules and finally chose this device just &#xA0;because of the 1w transmission power support. The actual advantage of this device comes from the support for UART communication. You can plug 2 devices into a computer with USB-UART adaptors and start &#xA0;configuring and testing the device. I started using CoolTerm app on my Mac for debugging and understanding the behaviour of this device. The manufacturer EByte has give a beautiful <a href="https://www.ebyte.com/en/pdf-down.aspx?id=672&amp;ref=localhost">documentation</a> for this module. It actually didn&apos;t help me much in the beginning while I was trying to understand the behaviour of the device. Later once you get the hang of it, the document comes handy as reference. </p><p>The device has M0 and M1 pins for configuring operating modes (Normal, Wake-up, Power svaing and sleep). Many articles say, there pins can be ignored, but neirhter ignoring nor connecting directly to ground worked for me. Only thing that worked for me is connecting them to GPIO pins (17 and 27) and programatically setting the high or low for different modes. To configure the settings using commands, you need to first set the device to Sleep mode. Then in normal mode, the device uses the persisted config. So I decided to use the GPIO pins to configure on program startup so even if I swap the devices, the new settings will take effect. </p><p>Note: You can configure and persist the setting once using a computer, and then use the UART to just send data directly. This also did work as expected. </p><p>The device has another AUX pin which becomes very important when sending large data continuously. For sending data at an interval greater than the transmission time (usually a few 10 milliseconds), you don&apos;t need to worry about this pin. The pin tells us if the data written previously is being ready by the internal transmitter module. So you need to wait until the pin signals you that it is ready for more data. </p><h3 id="connecting-to-raspberry-pi">Connecting to Raspberry Pi:</h3><p>For my project, I chose Raspberry Pi Zero W for various obvious reasons. They are small enough and computers running Linux rather than MCUs.

Don&apos;t hesitate to choose our good old cpp over other languages. We decided to use cpp (at Smackall Games) for few reasons. To make our game engine cross-platform, and to take the full power of the system under control.<br><br><strong>None of the Game Engines, satisfied you?</strong><br>With all passionate programmers around, we never felt satisfied with any of the game engines (both open source or commercial). Open Source Engines might have tough to understand licensing systems. And commercial engines do not let you work as a programmer, they are mostly designed for graphics designers. So if you hate using other game engines, you should try to write your own, at least once in your life time as a game developer. It is not a simple task as you might think, but don&apos;t hesitate to integrate other popular Rendering engines, Physics Engines or Scripting systems. Which will reduce the time to build your own Engine.<br><br><strong>No File format works for you.</strong><br>This is nothing new for a game developer. None of the file formats available are helpful in all cases. They either take too much space, too much time to load, or store too much information that you don&apos;t need. This happened every time we chose a format. We finally ended up writing our own file formats and Import/Export scripts for 3D editors (in our case, Blender). We quickly wrote a export script for Blender, to export Mesh as SGM, Rigged Mesh SGR, Animated Mesh SGA, Physics shapes as SGP and the level setup as SGX. Each format took us around 3 days to complete.<br><br>More to come...<br></p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
