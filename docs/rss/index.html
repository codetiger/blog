To be honest, this seemed to me like a life saver for hobbyists to start on RF. My previous attempts failed with I had to add RF to my projects. This time it was mostly a plug and play with simple configurations. </p><h3 id="speed">Speed: </h3><p>I read everywhere saying Lora is for smaller data packets and are not meant for larger data like images. There were some calculations showing Lora would take hours or days to transfer a single image. These are not fully true and are mostly limited to certain providers. In my project I needed a P2P data transfer and it worked just fine. </p><p>Initially I started with transfering 40 bytes of sensor data every 5 seconds which worked just fine. After analysing the logs, I found that the Chip completes the air transmission in few milliseconds and just waits for more data. So I decided to push more data by breaking an image into chunks and rebuilding it on the receiver size. </p><p>An image of size 38KB takes me around 5 mins to transfer with enough delay inbetween to avoid the buffer overflows. There is no easy way to calculate the exact delay needed for each chunk to get transfered, or depending on AUX alone as well did not help my case much. So I&apos;ve implemented a hybrid aproach that worked for me.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/12/latest-7.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="640" height="360" srcset="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/latest-7.jpg 600w, https://codetiger.github.io/blog/content/images/2021/12/latest-7.jpg 640w"></figure><h3 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement:</h3><p>In my implementation, the Lora class accepts file size of upto few megabytes and internally splits and sends it in chunks. The sender ensures if the chunk was received successfully by marking the chunk after getting an acknowledgement. The reason why AUX alone didn&apos;t work for me was, both the transceivers had to send and receive messages and the module didn&apos;t support duplex transmission. So a predefined interval of delay helped in my case. Otherwise, the 38KB image can be transferred in less than a minute. </p><h3 id="implementation">Implementation:</h3><p>The source code is available in my <a href="https://github.com/codetiger/rpi-hab/blob/main/lora.py">Github project</a>. The Lora class uses SQLite for keeping track of chunks and acknowledgements. This class is the same as explained in my previous post where I&apos;ve explained the basics <a href="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/transfer-images-over-lora-e32-module/">integrating E32-868T30D with Raspberry Pi</a></p><p>Using this implementation, I&apos;ve run the project for couple days in a row and there was no issue in buffer overflow.

Especially for electronics hobbyists like me who are self taught and have very limited knowledge in RF communication domain, these new Lora modules have made life easier. There is no introduction needed for these modules as the entire community is talking about, so I straightaway jump into the subject. </p><p>For my recent hobby project (shall be explained in future posts), I need a long range communications module between 2 Raspberry Pi based devices. The approximate distance is roughly 30 kms within line of sight. The 30kms and line of sight should be enough to guess what am planning to do. However, I&apos;ll still keep that for another post. The easiest way to achieve long range communication today without the need for licenses, is using a Lora module. As it already supports ISM band and modules are already available for various bands depending on the country. </p><h3 id="regulations">Regulations:</h3><p>In India, the ISM band range of frequency 865 - 867 MHz is delicensed and allocated for general purpose use. The regulatory documents say, we are allowed to use a max of 1w transmission power within this range. The standard Lora modules are pre-configured for various global ISM bands like 433MHz, 868MHz and 915MHz. Now, if you notice, none of these frequencies are within the ISM band in India. Closest is 868MHz however, it is outside of the specified range. </p><p>Thanks to the operating frequency range of the Lora modules, each model supports a range of frequencies meant to support a range of channels. The device I chose for my project is E32-868T30D which supports frequency range from 862 MHz to 893 MHz. I was bit confused as the regulations did not explicitly mention whether the 865 and 867 frequencies are inclusive in the allowed range. So just to be on the safer side, I configured by devices to communicate in 866 MHz which is well within the range.</p><h3 id="lora-e32-868t30d">Lora E32-868T30D:</h3><p>In fact, I did a lot of research on various modules and finally chose this device just &#xA0;because of the 1w transmission power support. The actual advantage of this device comes from the support for UART communication. You can plug 2 devices into a computer with USB-UART adaptors and start &#xA0;configuring and testing the device. I started using CoolTerm app on my Mac for debugging and understanding the behaviour of this device. The manufacturer EByte has give a beautiful <a href="https://www.ebyte.com/en/pdf-down.aspx?id=672">documentation</a> for this module. It actually didn&apos;t help me much in the beginning while I was trying to understand the behaviour of the device. Later once you get the hang of it, the document comes handy as reference. </p><p>The device has M0 and M1 pins for configuring operating modes (Normal, Wake-up, Power svaing and sleep). Many articles say, there pins can be ignored, but neirhter ignoring nor connecting directly to ground worked for me. Only thing that worked for me is connecting them to GPIO pins (17 and 27) and programatically setting the high or low for different modes. To configure the settings using commands, you need to first set the device to Sleep mode. Then in normal mode, the device uses the persisted config. So I decided to use the GPIO pins to configure on program startup so even if I swap the devices, the new settings will take effect. </p><p>Note: You can configure and persist the setting once using a computer, and then use the UART to just send data directly. This also did work as expected. </p><p>The device has another AUX pin which becomes very important when sending large data continuously. For sending data at an interval greater than the transmission time (usually a few 10 milliseconds), you don&apos;t need to worry about this pin. The pin tells us if the data written previously is being ready by the internal transmitter module. So you need to wait until the pin signals you that it is ready for more data. </p><h3 id="connecting-to-raspberry-pi">Connecting to Raspberry Pi:</h3><p>For my project, I chose Raspberry Pi Zero W for various obvious reasons. They are small enough and computers running Linux rather than MCUs. Below wiring diagram explains the overall connections used. </p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="./..//content/images/2021/12/lora-E32-868T30D-2.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="720" height="405" srcset="https://codetiger.github.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2021/12/lora-E32-868T30D-2.png 600w, https://codetiger.github.io/blog/content/images/2021/12/lora-E32-868T30D-2.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Remember to connect the Tx pin of RPi to Rx pin of Lora module and the Rx pin of RPi to Tx pin of Lora module.
